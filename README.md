# VirtualDragAndDrop

This programs create a virtual drag and drop on objects represented by their centers. I used rectanger for this example.  

To use the program, just run the file main.py. Then to move an object, you have to "grap it" = close your hand when your hand is on the object. Then opening your hand will release the object.  

I used **Python** with *OpenCV* and *cvzone* to detect the hand. A next step would be to recreate the hand detection by myself.
